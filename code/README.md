Experiemental interface that uses light as an interface to output tones & melodies. It can be played by a single player or as a dialog between two players.

Orange = 3.5V  
Black = GND  
Red = 5V  
White = A0–A3 (photoresistors)  
Hardwired Red = 4,5,6–13 (speakers & LEDs)  
Violet & White = SCL & SDA (ISL)

### To–Do

- [ ] Lights change color and luminance in set pattern
- [ ] All sensors pick up reliable readings
- [ ] Readings are normalized
- [ ] Both speakers output tone
- [ ] Speakers output normalized value
- [ ] Intensity readings change frequency
- [ ] Color readings change delay
- [ ] Add Schematic
