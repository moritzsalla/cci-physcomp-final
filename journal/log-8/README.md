#### Complex tones

I want to use two loudspeakers to create a more complex soundscape. However, by standard, the tone function is limited to a single output. Also, how do I play audio files instead of tones? Is this an efficient thing to do or will it be laggy?

#### Finding a better material for the enclosure

Went to another art supply shop. Silicone/latex seems the way to go. He only had the brown one though, albeit selling pigments. Pigments wont work because they likely make the material opaque. I need it semi translucent. Need to order this stuff on the internet.
